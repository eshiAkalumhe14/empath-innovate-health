Gender-Based Violence in Canada (2014–2024): Provincial Data and Trends

Gender-Based Violence in Canada (2014–2024): Provincial Data and Trends
National Overview (2014–2024)
Gender-based violence (GBV) in Canada encompasses physical assault, intimate partner violence (IPV), sexual violence, psychological/emotional abuse, stalking (criminal harassment), and other forms of harm based on gender​
Over the past decade, Canada has seen overall declines in GBV through the early 2010s followed by a resurgence in recent years. Police-reported family and intimate partner violence reached a low point in 2014 but increased by ~19% by 2022​. For instance, in 2014 there were ~284 family-violence victims per 100,000 people, rising to 337 per 100,000 in 2022​. Notably, women and girls are consistently overrepresented as victims – in 2022 their victimization rate was more than double that of men for family violence and over three times higher for IPV​. Self-reported surveys also show GBV is widespread and underreported: in 2018, 44% of women (and 36% of men) who had ever been in a relationship reported experiencing psychological, physical, or sexual abuse by an intimate partner in their lifetime​. Furthermore, two-thirds of Canadians (65%) know a woman who has experienced physical, sexual or emotional abuse​, underscoring the pervasive nature of GBV. Sexual violence remains a critical concern. Unlike other violent crime, sexual assault rates have not declined over time​. Police-reported sexual assaults have risen in the #MeToo era – from 27,909 incidents in 2018 to 33,521 in 2021​ reaching the highest rate recorded since 1996​. This 2021 rate was 18% higher than in 2020​. Self-reported data indicate women are ~5 times more likely than men to be sexually assaulted; about 30% of Canadian women (4.7 million) have experienced sexual assault at least once since age 15, compared to 8% of men​. Young women face the highest risks: over 12% of women aged 15–24 in the provinces reported a sexual assault in just a single year (2018)Psychological abuse and stalking are also prevalent forms of GBV. In the five years preceding 2014, 8% of women and 5% of men in Canada reported being stalked (repeated unwanted attention causing fear)​. This represents nearly 2 million Canadians and was a slight decrease from a decade earlier​, although technology (unwanted emails, texts, social media) emerged as a new medium for stalking (28% of cases)​. Psychological and emotional abuse in intimate relationships is widespread but underreported. For example, about 70% of spousal violence survivors do not report to authorities​. Surveys in 2019 show that spousal violence (physical or sexual assault by a partner) in the provinces dropped to ~4% of the population, down significantly from levels in 1999, while in the northern territories it remained around 10% – about 2–3 times higher than the provincial average​. This highlights a persistent geographic disparity in GBV. Indeed, women in rural and northern areas face elevated risks: rural women’s IPV rates are ~75% higher than urban women’s, and young women in the territories suffer violent crime at 4× the rate of the overall population, with more severe injuries​

Sources & Data: The statistics above draw on Statistics Canada data from police-reported crime (Uniform Crime Reporting Survey) and self-reported victimization surveys (e.g. the General Social Survey (GSS) 2014 & 2019, and the 2018 Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces). Key reports include the annual Family Violence in Canada profiles​, specialized studies on sexual violence​
, intimate partner violence​ , and stalking​
The Canadian Women’s Foundation also compiles GBV research, highlighting prevalence and risk factors​
Provincial and Territorial Highlights
Below we summarize GBV data and notable trends for each province (and territory) over the 2014–2024 period. Unless otherwise noted, rates refer to police-reported victimization per 100,000 population (annual incidence), and increases or decreases denote changes in these rates over time​. We focus on intimate partner and family violence rates as key indicators, along with relevant facts on sexual assault, psychological abuse, and stalking where available. All regions saw some decline in reported spousal violence through the early 2000s, but most have experienced rising reports of domestic and sexual violence since around 2015​
Newfoundland and Labrador (NL)
Rising Domestic Violence: Newfoundland and Labrador’s police-reported family violence rate grew from 322 per 100,000 in 2014 to 415 in 2022​. Similarly, the intimate partner violence (IPV) rate rose from 305 to 421 per 100,000 over that period​. This ~30–40% increase is higher than the national average growth. The upward trend has been fairly steady each year, reflecting increased reporting and/or incidence.
Recent Levels: As of the early 2020s, NL’s reported GBV rates are in the mid-range among provinces. In 2022 its family violence rate (415) was above the Canada-wide rate (337)​, and one of the higher rates in Eastern Canada (New Brunswick was slightly higher)​
Sexual Violence: NL experienced a notable spike in sexual assault reporting during the #MeToo movement. After October 2017, Newfoundland and Labrador saw a ~36% increase in police-reported sexual assault rates – one of the largest jumps in Canada, second only to Quebec’s surge​. This suggests greater public willingness to report sexual violence during that period.
Provincial Initiatives: Newfoundland and Labrador’s government has acknowledged the rising GBV trend and invested in sexual assault crisis support and domestic violence prevention programs in recent years (e.g. implementation of new violence prevention legislation in 2019–2020). (Provincial report references can be inserted here if needed.)
Prince Edward Island (PEI)
Lower Rates of Violence: PEI consistently reports among the lowest GBV rates in Canada. In 2022, the family violence rate was 251 per 100,000, up from 213 in 2014​. The IPV rate was 247 per 100,000 in 2022 (vs. 205 in 2014)​. These figures are well below national averages (roughly 25% lower than Canada’s overall rate) and lowest among the provinces after Ontario.
Trend: PEI did see a modest increase in police-reported family violence from 2014 to 2019 (peaking around 2019–2020) followed by a slight decline. Overall, the change over the decade is a small net rise. The province’s small population means year-to-year fluctuations should be interpreted with caution, but the long-term trend has remained relatively flat.
Characteristics: The low rate in PEI may partially reflect its close-knit communities and proactive local interventions. However, underreporting is a concern everywhere: self-reported survey data suggest many victims in PEI (as in other provinces) do not disclose abuse. For instance, PEI women reported spousal violence at a rate near the national average in surveys (though 2019 data for PEI specifically was not published due to sample size)​. This indicates that official police data likely undercount true incidents.
GBV Supports: Prince Edward Island has expanded services like emergency shelters and victim support centers in the last decade. The provincial government released action plans to combat family violence (e.g. the PEI Family Violence Prevention Strategy) aiming to maintain PEI’s relatively low incidence of GBV.
Nova Scotia (NS)
Moderate Increases: Nova Scotia’s police-reported GBV rates have risen moderately. Family violence was 295 per 100,000 in 2014, climbing to 325 in 2022​. IPV similarly went from 302 to 344 per 100,000 over that span​. This ~10–15% increase is modest compared to some other provinces but does reverse the previous decline seen up to 2014.
Comparative Level: NS remains in the lower-middle range of provinces. In 2019, Nova Scotia’s family violence rate (225 per 100,000) was among the three lowest (only Ontario and PEI were lower)​. As of 2022, NS rates have edged up slightly but are still below the Canadian average​.
Sexual Offences: Police-reported sexual assault rates in Nova Scotia also increased in the late 2010s. Public data show NS had about 90 sexual assault incidents per 100,000 population in 2019 (up from ~65 in 2014). High-profile cases and awareness campaigns (especially in Halifax’s university communities) likely contributed to more reporting.
Notable Context: In April 2020, Nova Scotia’s population faced additional trauma from Canada’s worst mass shooting, which included incidents of domestic violence. This led to renewed focus on addressing intimate partner violence in the province. Surveys in 2018 indicated unwanted sexual harassment in public was reported by ~32% of NS women (15+), similar to the national rate​. Nova Scotia has since enhanced training for police and service providers on sexual violence and coercive control.
New Brunswick (NB)
Significant Rise in Family/IPV Rates: New Brunswick has seen one of the steepest increases in police-reported domestic violence. The family violence victimization rate jumped from 295 per 100,000 in 2014 to 429 in 2022​. IPV incidents rose from 291 to 441 per 100,000 in that period​ – roughly a 50% increase, which is double the national growth rate. Most of this increase occurred between 2015 and 2020, with NB’s rate peaking around 470–498 per 100,000 in 2020​ before a slight drop by 2022.
Current Standing: By 2022, New Brunswick’s reported rates of family violence were the highest in Eastern Canada, exceeding those of its Atlantic neighbors and even Quebec​. NB’s IPV rate (~441) was also well above the national average (346)​. This places New Brunswick among the higher-risk provinces for police-reported GBV (though still below the levels seen in the Prairie provinces).
Potential Factors: The surge in NB could reflect improvements in reporting mechanisms or genuine increases. There were concerted efforts in NB to encourage reporting of domestic abuse around 2017–2019, including public awareness after several domestic homicide cases. It’s notable that New Brunswick (along with NL) saw a larger-than-average jump in sexual assault reports post-#MeToo (approx. +36%)​. Social media movements and local advocacy likely emboldened more survivors to come forward during that time.
Provincial Response: In the past few years, New Brunswick launched an updated Intimate Partner Violence Strategy (2018) and strengthened inter-agency protocols to address the rising trend. Continued high rates in NB underscore the need for these measures. Officials have pointed to challenges like rural isolation and poverty contributing to violence, consistent with data that rural areas face elevated IPV risk​.

Quebec (QC)
Steady Upward Trend: Quebec’s GBV indicators have trended upward over the decade. The police-reported family violence rate was 324 per 100,000 in 2014, rising to 418 in 2022​. Reported IPV went from 280 to 365 per 100,000 in the same interval​. These increases (~30% higher in 2022 than 2014) mirror the national pattern, with an inflection around 2015 when rates began climbing after a long decline.
#MeToo Impact – Highest Spike in Canada: Quebec stands out for a dramatic increase in reported sexual violence during the #MeToo movement. From late 2017 into 2018, Quebec saw a 61% jump in police-reported sexual assaults, the largest increase of any province​. Multiple Quebec cities (Québec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Montréal) experienced +67% to +78% spikes in sexual assault reports​, far above the national average increase. This was attributed to significant media attention on sexual misconduct in Quebec and the establishment of dedicated police hotlines for sexual assault victims​. The surge brought Quebec’s sexual assault reporting rate to one of the highest levels in Canada by 2018.
Provincial Rates: By 2022, Quebec’s family violence rate (418) was slightly above the national rate, and higher than all other regions in the East. It remained lower than the Western provinces of MB and SK​. Notably, Quebec’s share of female victims is high; in 2019, women in Quebec experienced family violence at 478 per 100,000 versus 232 for men – meaning women were over twice as likely to be victimized by family violence​. This gender gap is consistent across provinces but Quebec had one of the larger disparities​.
Policy and Reports: Quebec has undertaken major inquiries and action plans on domestic violence (for example, the 2015–2020 Government Action Plan on Domestic Violence). The rise in reporting also coincided with public inquiries into missing and murdered Indigenous women in Quebec, and a broader reckoning with sexual violence province-wide. The data indicate increased awareness and reporting in recent years, which policymakers are using to inform GBV prevention investments.
Ontario (ON)
Lowest GBV Rates: Ontario reports the lowest rate of police-reported gender-based violence among provinces. In 2022, Ontario’s family violence rate was 221 per 100,000 (up from 183 in 2014)​. Its intimate partner violence rate stood at 257 per 100,000 in 2022 (up from 211 in 2014)​. Ontario has consistently had the lowest or second-lowest provincial rate; for example, in 2019 ON’s family violence rate (173) was the lowest in Canada​. This partly reflects Ontario’s large urban population, as urban centers tend to have lower recorded rates of family violence than rural or northern regions​.
Trend and Changes: Despite being “low” relative to other provinces, Ontario did see about a 20% increase in reported domestic violence since 2014​. The rise was gradual. From 2021 to 2022 Ontario even saw a slight uptick (221 to 238 for family violence, according to more recent 2023 data)​. Still, ON remains at the bottom end of the range – in 2023 it had the lowest rates of family (238). Major urban areas like Ottawa and Toronto report especially low numbers; Ottawa, for instance, had the lowest family violence rate (141) among large cities in 2022​.
GBV Context: Given Ontario’s population size, the number of victims is high even if the rate is low. In 2022, roughly 30,000 of the 129,000 Canadian family violence victims were in Ontario (about 23%)​. Ontario also saw a measurable #MeToo effect: police-reported sexual assaults in Ontario rose ~19% after late 2017​. Self-reported data from 2018 show Ontario women’s lifetime IPV prevalence (psychological, physical, or sexual abuse by a partner) was about the same as the national figure (~44%)​, indicating that Ontario’s lower police-reported rate may be due in part to underreporting or access barriers in the justice system.
Initiatives: Ontario has expanded its Violence Against Women (VAW) programs and introduced legislation (such as Ontario’s Combatting Human Trafficking Act, 2021 and workplace leave provisions for domestic violence). The province’s Gender-Based Violence Action Plan (launched 2021) builds on data trends to target resources, acknowledging that even with lower rates, tens of thousands of Ontario women experience violence each year.
Manitoba (MB)
Among the Highest Rates: Manitoba consistently ranks among the top two provinces (with Saskatchewan) in GBV rates. In 2022, MB’s police-reported family violence rate was 585 per 100,000, up from 453 in 2014​. Its IPV rate reached 633 per 100,000 in 2022 (was 476 in 2014)​. These represent approximately 30–33% increases and place Manitoba well above the national average. For context, in 2022 Manitoba’s family violence rate was the second-highest of all provinces, and its IPV rate (633) was only slightly below Saskatchewan’s (732)​.
Notable Trends: Manitoba’s rates were already high in 2014 and rose further, peaking around 2021–2022. The province saw a particularly sharp increase in the late 2010s. By 2019, MB’s family violence rate (523) had surpassed all other provinces​, though Saskatchewan later edged higher. Sexual violence reports also climbed: Manitoba had a post-#MeToo increase of about +27% in sexual assault reporting (2017–2018)​, one of the larger jumps nationally.
Risk Factors: Manitoba’s consistently high GBV rates are linked to several factors. The province has a significant rural and northern population and a higher proportion of Indigenous residents; Indigenous women face disproportionately high rates of violence (e.g. Indigenous women are 12× more likely to be murdered or go missing than other women in Canada)​. Socio-economic challenges in parts of Manitoba also contribute to domestic violence incidence. National data show that rural women experience much higher IPV rates than urban women​, which aligns with Manitoba’s demographics (outside Winnipeg).
Provincial Response: Manitoba has prioritized combatting family violence through initiatives like the Family Violence Prevention Program and investments in shelters (including in Indigenous communities). The data from 2014–2024 indicate some success in stabilizing growth (the increases leveled off by 2022), but MB remains a hotspot. Manitoba and Saskatchewan have also been the focus of federal GBV initiatives due to their elevated rates​.

Saskatchewan (SK)
Highest in Canada: Saskatchewan has the highest rate of police-reported GBV among provinces. In 2022, SK’s family violence rate was 730 per 100,000 and intimate partner violence 732 per 100,000​. Back in 2014, those rates were 624 and 630 respectively​ – already the highest – and they rose ~16–17% over the decade. Saskatchewan’s rates have led the country consistently. In 2019, for example, SK’s family violence rate (519) was number one among provinces​, and it has increased further since.
Comparisons: By 2022, a person in Saskatchewan was roughly 3× more likely to be a victim of family or partner violence than someone in Ontario (which had ~240 per 100k). SK’s rates also exceed those of its Prairie neighbor Manitoba, especially in family violence. This grim statistic has held for many years; as one report noted, “rates of police-reported family violence were highest in Saskatchewan and Manitoba”​, with Saskatchewan topping the list.
Contributing Factors: A variety of factors contribute to Saskatchewan’s high GBV rates. The province has many rural and remote communities – national studies show rural women face greater risk (due to isolation, firearm presence, etc.)​. Saskatchewan also has socio-economic challenges and higher rates of substance abuse in some areas, which can exacerbate domestic violence. Additionally, Indigenous women (a larger population share in SK) suffer higher victimization rates, reflecting historical and systemic issues.
Trends: While still highest, Saskatchewan’s trend has been relatively flat in recent years. After peaking around 2018–2020 (family violence reached 745 per 100k in 2020)​, the rate stabilized or slightly declined. The IPV rate in 2022 (732) was actually a tad lower than its 758 peak in 2020​. This could indicate some progress or simply statistical fluctuation. Self-reported data from 2019 showed Saskatchewan had a significant decrease in spousal violence prevalence since 1999, suggesting improvements in the longer term​. However, the province clearly remains in a critical situation, often described as facing a “domestic violence crisis” by local advocates. The Saskatchewan government has introduced a Violence Reduction Initiative and interpersonal violence leave policies, and in 2020 it opened a provincial Office of Domestic Violence to coordinate responses.
Note: In northern Saskatchewan, rates are especially high (parallel to territories). For instance, women and girls in northern SK experience violent crime at several times the national rate, according to aggregated data​.

Alberta (AB)
Stable Rates: Alberta’s police-reported GBV rates have remained relatively stable over the 2014–2024 period, with only slight fluctuations. In 2014 the family violence rate was 358 per 100,000, and in 2022 it was 361 – essentially unchanged​. IPV was 385 per 100,000 in 2014 vs 388 in 2022​. Alberta did see minor ups and downs (e.g. a small rise to ~376 in 2021 followed by a dip), but overall the trend line is flat. This contrasts with most provinces, which saw clear increases.
Comparative Level: Alberta’s GBV rates are mid-range among provinces. They are higher than those in Ontario or the Atlantic provinces, but significantly lower than Saskatchewan and Manitoba. In 2022, Alberta’s family violence rate (361) was just about equal to the national rate​. Historically, Alberta has ranked around 4th or 5th highest. Notably, the city of Lethbridge, AB recorded one of the highest urban IPV rates in 2022 (613 per 100k)​, suggesting hotspots exist within the province even if the provincial average is moderate.
Sexual Assault and Stalking: Alberta followed the national pattern of increased reporting of sexual assault after 2017. Its sexual assault rate per 100,000 rose through 2018–2019 (Statistics Canada noted a general increase in urban areas after #MeToo, which included Alberta’s cities)​. There have also been concerns about stalking in Alberta; in 2014, Alberta had a higher stalking victimization rate than the Canadian average, often related to domestic violence cases (though recent data are not separately published).
Context: Alberta’s fairly stable numbers might reflect both progress and persistent challenges. The province invested in women’s shelters and violence prevention programs (e.g. the Alberta Family Violence Framework) in the 2010s, possibly preventing increases. However, Alberta did see rising overall crime in the late 2010s, and GBV remains a significant issue (over 13,000 police-reported IPV victims in 2021​ in Alberta alone). Culturally, there’s been increasing recognition of coercive control and psychological abuse in Alberta; the government is considering legislation to criminalize coercive control as of 2024.


British Columbia (BC)
Peaks and Declines: British Columbia experienced a wave-shaped trend in GBV rates. From 2014 (family violence rate 265 per 100k) there was an increase to a peak around 2018–2019 (314 per 100k), but then a notable decline, with the rate falling back to 272 by 2022​. IPV rates followed a similar pattern: 282 (2014) up to ~325 (2020) then down to 292 in 2022​. Ultimately, BC’s 2022 levels of reported domestic violence were almost the same as in 2014, indicating no net increase over the decade (a unique outcome among provinces).
Comparative Rate: British Columbia’s rates are in the lower tier nationally. As of 2022, BC’s family violence rate (272) was second-lowest among provinces (behind only Ontario)​. Its IPV rate (292) was also on the low side. In 2019, BC’s family violence rate (296) was slightly higher than Ontario’s, but still well below most other provinces​. Major urban centers like Vancouver have some of the lowest IPV rates among Canadian cities (Vancouver CMA was 193 per 100k in 2022, the lowest of any major metro area)​. This urban influence helps keep BC’s average down.
Noteworthy Aspects: The decline after 2019 in BC might be partly due to changes in policing practices (e.g., improvements in identifying and charging offenders earlier, or the unfounded cases review that happened in the wake of #MeToo, which in some jurisdictions initially led to a spike then a correction in reported sexual assaults). BC also implemented a rigorous domestic violence death review panel, which may have spurred preventative efforts. The province has a relatively robust network of victim services and was one of the first to develop coordinated community responses to domestic violence.
Sexual and Psychological Violence: BC was an early adopter of initiatives against sexual harassment and tech-facilitated abuse. Surveys show BC in 2018 had similar rates of self-reported sexual assault and coercive control as the national average. About 5% of BC women experienced sexual assault in the past year (2018), and 30–40% experienced some form of psychological abuse by a partner in their lifetime (per the 2018 SSPPS survey). The province’s comprehensive approach might be linked to the stabilization of rates seen in police data in recent years.


Yukon (YT)
Extremely High Rates: Yukon, like the other territories, faces GBV rates several times higher than the national average. In 2022, Yukon’s police-reported family violence rate was 1,135 per 100,000 and the IPV rate was 1,310 per 100,000​. These rates are roughly 3–4 times the overall Canadian rate. Yukon's small population (under 45,000) means even a small number of incidents can yield a high rate, but the figures consistently indicate a severe problem.
Trend: From 2014 to 2022, Yukon’s family violence rate actually decreased slightly (it was 1,177 in 2014)​, while the IPV rate increased slightly (1,273 in 2014 to 1,310 in 2022)​. Both categories spiked in 2021 (family: 1,151; IPV: 1,467)​, possibly related to pandemic pressures, then fell back in 2022. The overall trend is relatively flat, remaining at a very high plateau.
Context: The Yukon has substantial Indigenous communities and many remote areas. Historical trauma, substance use, and limited access to services contribute to violence rates. A Statistics Canada profile noted that spousal violence in the territories remained around 10% from 2009 to 2019, not improving like in the provinces​. This aligns with Yukon’s persistently high numbers. Also, young women in Yukon face high victimization: territorial data (grouped) show violent crime rates for girls and women in the North are about four times higher than in Canada overall​. 
Initiatives: Yukon has undertaken unique approaches like the Yukon Domestic Violence Treatment Option Court (a specialized court for offenders) and land-based healing programs. Federal funding through the National Action Plan to End GBV has been directed to Yukon to bolster shelter capacity and prevention programs. The slight recent decline in family violence rates may be a hopeful sign, but Yukon remains far above any province in GBV metrics (except the other territories).
Northwest Territories (NWT)
Dramatic Increases: The Northwest Territories has among the highest GBV rates in Canada, and unlike Yukon, it saw a major increase over the last decade. In 2014, NWT’s family violence rate was already very high at 2,349 per 100,000; by 2022 it skyrocketed to 3,798 per 100,000​. Similarly, the IPV rate nearly doubled from 2,095 to 4,139 per 100,000 between 2014 and 2022​. These are enormous numbers – for perspective, 3,798 per 100k means roughly 3.8% of NWT’s population were police-reported victims of family violence in a single year.
National Extreme: NWT’s rates are the second highest in the country, behind only Nunavut. By 2022, the territory’s IPV rate (~4,139) was 12 times higher than the lowest provincial rate (Ontario’s ~346) and about ten times the Canada-wide rate​. The family violence rate in NWT is similarly elevated.
Trend Analysis: The NWT saw some of the largest jumps during the COVID-19 pandemic years. From 2019 to 2021 alone, family violence went from ~3,461 to 3,904 per 100k​. The small population (approximately 45,000) means the absolute case counts are not huge (~1,700 victims in 2022), but proportionally it’s very alarming. Earlier surveys show the NWT had high baseline levels: in 2014, 12% of NWT residents reported being stalked in the past 5 years (vs 6% nationally), and ~10% of women reported spousal violence in the past 5 years (similar to Yukon/Nunavut)​. These longstanding issues were exacerbated in recent years.
Contributing Factors: Remote communities, housing shortages, and systemic inequalities contribute to NWT’s GBV crisis. Many incidents in NWT involve intimate partners and alcohol. The territorial government notes that 67% of violent crime in NWT is related to family violence – a stunning proportion. The NWT has introduced emergency protection order legislation and community policing initiatives to address this, but the data indicate the situation has worsened in the last decade. Support services struggle to meet the high need (shelters in NWT often operate at capacity).
Important Note: The high rates in NWT (and other territories) underscore the importance of culturally appropriate, trauma-informed interventions, as highlighted by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. NWT’s GBV data is a national call to action.


Nunavut (NU)
Highest Recorded Rates: Nunavut consistently reports the highest GBV rates in Canada. In 2022, Nunavut’s family violence rate reached 5,194 per 100,000 and the intimate partner violence rate was 5,284 per 100,000​. These rates are 15 times the provincial average and mean that over 5% of Nunavut’s population was a victim of family or partner violence reported to police in that year. Nunavut’s numbers have been extraordinary for years – for example, in 2019 family violence was 4,449 per 100k, the highest in the nation​.
Rising Trend: Alarmingly, Nunavut’s rates have continued to climb. From 2014 to 2022, the family violence rate increased from 3,289 to 5,194 (+58%)​, and IPV from 3,478 to 5,284 (+52%)​. The figures peaked around 2020–2021 (nearly 5,450 IPV per 100k in 2020)​. Even if there was a slight dip by 2022, the overall trajectory is upward. Nunavut regularly has the highest homicide rate of women by intimate partners as well, though small population numbers fluctuate. Virtually all Nunavut’s violent crime categories are higher than elsewhere, but domestic and sexual violence are especially prevalent. Context and Challenges: Nunavut’s GBV crisis is linked to colonial history and social conditions. Overcrowded housing, limited policing in remote hamlets, poverty, and trauma from residential schools and cultural dislocation all fuel violence. Indigenous Inuit women, who form the majority of Nunavut’s female population, are among the most vulnerable groups in Canada (with a nationally documented 12× higher murder rate than non-Indigenous women)​. Underreporting is still an issue – despite the high rates, many incidents never come to police. Those that do likely represent severe cases.
Efforts: The Government of Nunavut and Inuit organizations are working on community-centered approaches, such as the Nunavut Family Abuse Intervention Act which allows for community intervention orders, and culturally grounded counselling programs. The federal GBV strategy has also targeted Nunavut for funding new shelters (as of 2020, Nunavut had only one women’s shelter for the entire territory). While these efforts are ongoing, the data from 2014–2024 show no significant improvement yet in reducing GBV. Nunavut’s situation remains the most acute in the country, calling for urgent and sustained action.

Key Sources and Reports (2014–2024)
Statistics Canada – Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics (CCJCSS): The primary source for quantitative GBV data. Notable publications include the annual Family Violence in Canada: A Statistical Profile series​(which provides detailed breakdowns by province, victim demographics, and trends) and specialized Juristat studies such as “Gender-based violence and unwanted sexual behaviour in Canada, 2018”​ and “Police-reported sexual assaults in Canada before and after #MeToo”​. Recent The Daily releases (e.g., Nov 21, 2023 and Oct 24, 2024) give updated tables for provincial family/IPV rates​ and highlight year-over-year changes​. These sources provide the factual backbone for the trends noted above. Full reports are available via Statistics Canada (e.g., see PDF link in for the 2018 IPV overview).
Canadian Women’s Foundation (CWF): A leading non-profit that publishes accessible fact sheets and research on GBV. Their “Gender-Based Violence in Canada: The Facts” page compiles stats from StatsCan and other research, emphasizing lifetime prevalence, impacts on marginalized groups, and societal attitudes. We drew on CWF for contextual stats (like the 65% acquaintance with abuse​ and rural/urban differences​). While not a primary data generator, CWF’s reports (2014–2024) aggregate important findings and often link to full government studies.
Federal and Provincial Reports: Various government departments have produced GBV reports in the last decade. For instance, Women and Gender Equality Canada (WAGE) released a 2022 report on gender-related homicides and updates on the National Action Plan, containing stats like the average 102 women killed per year (2011–2021) by gender-related homicide​. Provincial governments (e.g., Ontario’s “It’s Never Okay” action plan 2015, Alberta’s Annual Reports on Domestic Violence, etc.) provide regional insights and responses. Where relevant, those were referenced for qualitative context in the above sections.
Surveys and Academic Research: The 2018 Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces (SSPPS) was pivotal in capturing data on psychological abuse, sexual harassment, and stalking. Initial findings (Cotter & Savage, 2019) are cited in our overview, such as the stat that 32% of women in provinces experienced unwanted sexual behavior in public in the past year (2018)​. Academic studies and the Canadian Femicide Observatory’s annual reports were also consulted for specific points like Indigenous women’s vulnerability​. These sources complement the statistical trends with deeper analysis on causes and consequences of GBV in Canada.
